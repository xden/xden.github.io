## Why write?
1. Help myself thinking
2. Share knowledge
3. Improve my writing

## Why self host the blog with Jekyll?
I spent almost a whole night to choose the best too that suit my needs.

### Problem with Medium

A popular platform for publishing writing. It is easy to use. However, 1) it does not support math formula (unless you want to convert formulas to pictures). 2) It does not support custom domain unless you pay.

### Problem with other static website generators

I tried many other static website generators, all of them can generate fancy looking sites but none of them looks good and simple to me. However, I am quite satisfied with the site generated by Jekyll. Plus, it has integration with Github Pages, so it is easier to host without publishing my static website files with some additional tools like Firebase or Netlify.

Jekyll doesn't support math formula out of box, so I added MathJax. The modification is quite simple, now I can write:

`$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$`

and it will be rendered as:

$$m = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$
